# Code folder 

This code contains three main files used to analyze data and produce figures. The [snowfence](snowfence.R) code was used to analyze experimental data, and the [observational](observational_data.R) code was used to analyze observations of leaf nitrogen concentrations under natural snow variation. In addition to these, there are separate code files used to [validate](spectra_validation.R) the hyperspectral estimates of leaf nitrogen concentration, a file used to record the hex files of the [color scheme](color_scheme.R) used throughout the plots, and [code](phenology_concept_diagram.R) used to create a [conceptual diagram](graphs/phenology_conceptual_diagram.png) of phenological shifts in leaf nitrogen that was not based on real data.
