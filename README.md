# Dissertation
This dissertation explores the relationship between snow and leaf nitrogen concentration in Arctic vegetation. First I explored whether there is a relationship between leaf nitrogen concentration and snow depth through experimental manipulations of snow depth using snow fences in three Arctic sites, and found that deeper snow leads to higher leaf nitrogen concentrations. As other studies have suggested, the mechanism is probably the insulative effect of deep snow raising soil temperatures, leading to higher soil microbe activity and higher rates of nitrogen mineralization, meaning there is more nitrogen available to plants the following spring. I also investigated whether this relationship between snow and nitrogen could be observed under natural variation. I used leaf nitrogen data from both existing observations, and estimates of leaf nitrogen concentration from leaf hyperspectral reflectances. I compared these data with winter precipitation, and did not find a relationship. When I compared these data with snowmelt date however, I found a positive relationship, matching the results of the snow fence experiments. This repository contains all of the data used in the project, the code used to analyze it, and the model results both in .RDS files and represented graphically.
